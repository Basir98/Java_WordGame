The selected word option is displayed on the top. The user then has to guess the masked word and click on submit. The user also has the option to change the word if he/she can not guess the word, which reduces one point. 
Another option is the "Hint" button which unmasks one additional character from the word. To end the game click on the "End Game" button.
